        <p><strong><span style="font-size: larger;">Improving and extending menu structure (Nico) </span></strong> <br><br>

        Included new menu pages and extended the options menu to allow the player to control the volume of the game music.<br><br>
            
        Following a short video to demonstrate the menu structure and the playing background sound. <br>    
        <video width="1000" height="720" controls>
  <source src="Sprint5/Menu_Sound_Video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video> <br>
            
         <br>To ensure that the menu windows always have the same starting position, we pass the positions of the currently displayed menu window to the upcoming window.<br>

        <p><strong><span style="font-size: larger;">Including background sound</span></strong> <br><br>
        
        We work with a config file to save changes made in the options menu. <br>
            
        <img src="Sprint5/config file.JPG" alt="Italian Trulli"> <br>
            
        Changing values in the options menu will overwrite the entries in the config file.<br>

            <img src="Sprint5/slider_value_changed.JPG" alt="Italian Trulli"> <br>
            
        It ensures that changes made will remain even if you quit and restart the game. <br>
        Currently our only entries are regarding the game sound. <br>
        A possible stretch goal could be to provide players with the ability to modify the game controls through the options menu and save the changes in the config file.<br>

        To play the music we implemented a class MusicPlayer:<br>
        
        <img src="Sprint5/class musicplayer.JPG" alt="Italian Trulli"> <br>    


        With following functions:<br>
        <img src="Sprint5/functionsmusicplayer.JPG" alt="Italian Trulli"> <br>

        Restart_playback causes the music to run in a loop. <br>
        The update_music function is called every 500 milliseconds and adjusts the volume of the music based on the value specified in the config file.<br>

        <b>Difficulties</b><br>
        Actually Finding an implementation where the music is played independently by the actions of the player in the main menu. <br> 
        In previous versions the music didnt loop or got restarted every time a window(menu) is switched. <br>
        Among others we tried to use threads to play the music which didnt end up working.  <br><br>
   
        <p><strong><span style="font-size: larger;">Improving Map Editor and including it in the menu structure</span></strong> <br><br>

        Remade the UI of the mapeditor with qtdesigner. <br>
        Put the buttons in an non-drawable area to the right. Beforehand they were in the midst of the screen<br>

        Implemented load function to convert an already saved txt.file back to a drawn arena. <br>

        <img src="Sprint5/LoadMap.JPG" alt="Italian Trulli"> <br><br>
            
            
        <b>Problem:</b><br>
        Circular dependency between the Menus.py and MapEditor.py file. Solved with following code line: <br>
        <img src="Sprint5/command_circular_dependency.JPG" alt="Italian Trulli"> <br>
        MapEditor only gets imported, when we actually switch to the MapEditor window.<br><br><br><br><br><br>


        <p><strong><span style="font-size: larger;">Adding Health and Weapons (Marcel John) </span></strong> <br><br>
        
        added maxHealth and health as ints<br>
        added function to heal and deal demage<br>
        <img src="Sprint5/healingAndDamage.png"><br>
        Weapons are objects we use enums to differentiate<br>
        <img src="Sprint5/weaponEnum.png"><br>
        The Weapon stores the attributes<br>
        <img src="Sprint5/weaponClass.png"><br>
        The inputHandler shoots the Weapon, also added a delay between shoots<br>
        <img src="Sprint5/shootInput.png"><br>
        For the drawing added helper functions to calculate the position of the health bar and the end point of the shoot<br>
        <img src="Sprint5/helperfuncForHealthAndShoot.png"><br>
        Drawing the healthbar and shoot<br>
        <img src="Sprint5/DrawHealthbarAndShoot.png"><br>
        <img src="Sprint5/inGameHealthbar.png"><br><br>
        To calculate if we hit we use vector Math<br>
        we treat our shot as a line a vector ab and the robot we are checking<br>
        to ac from end shot to center of robot we calculate the length. Using the length we normalize the vector ab<br>
        to get the direction. We get the distance using the dotproduct of the normalazied vector and ac.<br>
        The distace on line function enshures the closest point is on the line.<br>
        Now we make the Projection vector using distance and the direction.<br>
        Using this vector we can find the closest point on the line to our circle.<br>
        Now we only need to cheeck if the closest point is closer than the raidius than we apply the damage.<br>
