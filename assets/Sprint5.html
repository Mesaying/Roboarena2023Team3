        <p><strong><span style="font-size: larger;">Improving and extending menu structure</span></strong> <br>

        A short video to demonstrate the menu structure and the playing background sound. <br>    
        <video width="1000" height="720" controls>
  <source src="Sprint5/Menu_Sound_Video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
            
         <br>To ensure that the menu windows always have the same starting position, we pass the positions of the currently displayed menu window to the upcoming window.<br>

        <p><strong><span style="font-size: larger;">Including background sound</span></strong> <br>
        
        We work with a config file to save changes made in the options menu. <br>
        Changing values in the options menu will overwrite the entries in the config file.<br>

        It ensures that changes made will remain even if you quit and restart the game. <br>
        Currently our only entries are regarding the game sound. <br>
        A possible stretch goal could be to provide players with the ability to modify the game controls through the options menu and save the changes in the config file.<br>

        To play the music we implemented a class MusicPlayer:<br>

        With following functions:<br>
        <img src="Sprint5/functionsmusicplayer.JPG" alt="Italian Trulli"> <br>

        Restart_playback causes the music to run in a loop. <br>
        The update_music function is called every 500 milliseconds and adjusts the volume of the music based on the value specified in the config file.<br><br>
   
        <p><strong><span style="font-size: larger;">Improving Map Editor and including it in the menu structure</span></strong> <br>

        Remade the UI of the mapeditor with qtdesigner. <br>
        Put the buttons in an non-drawable area to the right. Beforehand they were in the midst of the screen<br>

        Implemented load function to convert an already saved txt.file back to a drawn arena. <br>

        Problem: <br>
        Circular dependency between the menus.py and mapeditor.py file. Solved with following code line: <br>
