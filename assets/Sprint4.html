    <b>Creating prototype game menus(Nico):  </b> <br><br>

    We worked with Qt Designer to create Ui-files which can be loaded through the loadui()function. <br>
    Working with Qt Designer is way more comfortable than trying to create the UI with grid based layouts since we can choose the positions of the buttons directly. <br>

    <b>Problem: </b> <br>
    The images we included in Qt Designer didnt show up when we executed the python code. <br>
    Therefore we add the images manually in the code. <br><br>

    <b> The functions, responsible for changing the menus </b> <br>

    An instance of the menu we want to visit is created and gets displayed.<br>
    Afterwards the old menu is closed.<br><br>

    Added an undo function, to delete the latest made drawing.<br>

    Added a new function, to revert the screen to its inital stage and delete all made drawings.<br>

    <p><strong><span style="font-size: larger;">Minimum viable product:</span></strong> <br>
-1v1 type of game mode controlled with one keyboard (local coop) <br>
-5 different types of terrain <br>
-Main Menu <br>
-Ability to shoot for both robots <br>
-in-game UI to show cooldown and health of robots <br>
-Main Menu <br>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: larger;">Stretch goals:</span></strong> <br>
-Different classes of robots <br>
-Multiple attack-abilities to choose from <br>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: larger;">Collision Detection:</span></strong> <br>
Implementing collision detection turned out to be a little more challenging than I thought. <br>
In the solution I ended up with I basically iterate over every tile the robots plans to move across. <br>
If we encounter any solid tiles within the radius of the robot, we stop moving at the last position at which there were no solid tiles within the robots radius.
<br>

Code for collision detection: <br>
