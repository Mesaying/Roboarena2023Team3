    <b>Creating prototype game menues(Nico):  </b> <br><br>
    
    We worked with Qt Designer to create Ui-files which can be loaded through the """"function. <br>
    Working with Qt Designer is way more comfortable than trying to create the Ui with grid based layouts  <br>
    since we can choose the positions of the buttons directly. <br>

    <b>Problem: </b> <br>
    The images we included in Qt Designer didnt show up when we executed the file. <br>
    Therefore we add the images manually in the code. <br><br>

    <b>Improving map editor:</b> <br>
    Added an undo function, to delete the latest made drawing.<br>
    Added a new function, to revert the screen to its inital stage and delete all made drawings.<br>
