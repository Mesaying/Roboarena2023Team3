<p><strong><span style="font-size: larger;">Task 1</span></strong> <br>
    
<p><strong><span style="font-size: larger;">Minimum viable product:</span></strong> <br>
-1v1 type of game mode controlled with one keyboard (local coop) <br>
-5 different types of terrain <br>
-Main Menu <br>
-Ability to shoot for both robots <br>
-in-game UI to show cooldown and health of robots <br>
-Main Menu <br>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: larger;">Stretch goals:</span></strong> <br>
-Different classes of robots
-Multiple attack-abilities to choose from <br>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: larger;">Collision Detection:</span></strong> <br>
Implementing collision detection turned out to be a little more challenging than I thought. <br>
In the solution I ended up with I basically iterate over every tile the robots plans to move across. <br>
If we encounter any solid tiles within the radius of the robot, we stop moving at the last position at which there were no solid tiles within the robots radius.
<br>
