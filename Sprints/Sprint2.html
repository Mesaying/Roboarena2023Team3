 <h2>Sprint 2</h2> 
<br>
<br>
<p> Task1 <br>
<p> We drafted a Mock Up of the Basic UI of the game.<br>
    The arena will consist of diffferent types of terrain each with it's unique effect on the robot.<br>
    For example, fire will damage the robots, water will slow them down.<br> 
    We plan to add different boosters like health package or double damage rune which the players can collect during a match.<br>
    Our robots will be fighting in real-time utilizing different weapons/abilities which can be selected before playing.<br>
    <br>
    Roboarena will support both a solo and a multiplayer mode, the multiplayer mode is planned to be local only for now.<br>
    In addition to each player the arena will be populated by different AI-driven robots the players will have to compete with.

<p> Task2 <br>

  Arena: 2 dimensional Array, size 100 * 100 to store all tiles<br>
  The arena is drawn based on a textfile. 
  We iterate through every letter in the textfile. Based on the letter different drawings happen in the arena and we 
  set the element in the array to the appropriate terrain.<br>
  At first the arena wasnt drawn correctly because line breaks were included in the array.
  We want to improve the map editor in the future and make the process of creating an arena more convenient.<br>
  
  
  Difficulty: We initially had a version where we initialised the screen first and then called a draw function to color the tiles.
  To our surprise this version didnt draw anything on the screen. <br>The solution was to implement a event-function which is executed
  automatically, when the screen is initialised. <br>

<p> Task3 <br>
We made a simple Robot class to encode the robots. Each robot has following attributes:<br>
position, radius, direction, color and movement speed. <br>
In the arena class the robots are represented by an Array of BasicRobots.
Whenever we redraw the arena each Robot in the array is drawn as a circle with its specified Radius and color at its position. We indicate each robots "forward direction" with a line.

<p> Task4 <br>
  The move function uses the direction and speed to calculate the velocity using cos and sine to walk in every direction.<br>
  Since we use sin and cos we need to typecast to int.<br>

  The Timer is from PyQt5 it is initialised as shown in task 2.<br>
  To move we call an update Function which calls the move Function to "move" the Robot.<br>

<p> Conclusion <br>
 We are satisfied with how the sprint went out. The programming part went relatively smooth, we have completed all tasks and
 hit our set goals.
