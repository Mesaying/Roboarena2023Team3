<p> Task1 <br>

c)
We changed the Robots from directly using a movement Speed variable to determine their speed to now calculate their current velocity using acceleration and the time between "frames".
The same thing was done to the calculation of rotational speed.

To avoid reaching infinite speeds we also introduced constants for maximum movement speed and maximum rotational speed.
This is where we deviate a little from the original Task and instead of a programm wide constant introduce a different constant for every "type" of robot. This will allow us to have more or less agile types of robots in the future.
Furthermore we did not clamp the robots aceleration but instead it's speed.
Implementation of speed and aceleration: <br>

<p>You can see the Robots moving here: <br>

d)
For threads we use a worker class that inherits from QThread.<br>
The MovementManager_ is a class that handles the movement wenn we start the thread we create an object of that class.<br>
The moveRobot function gets called using a signal it uses the Movement Manager to update the Position.<br>                                                                                                                               
<img src="assets/Sprint3/workerClass.png"><br>
Some Problems here since we also tried QThreadpool it would be easier to run multiple Threads but since it does not support signals and slots we choose the Qthread.<br>
The signal and a dictionary to store the threads.<br>
<img src="assets/Sprint3/SignalForWorker.png"><br>
This Function creates the threads and starts them:<br>
<img src="assets/Sprint3/RunThreads.png"><br>
The first for loop creates the threads and puts them in the dictionary.<br>
The second one  connects the signals and starts the threads.<br>

<p> Task2 <br>
For now we only drew 4 different tiles: Grass, Fire, Water and Wall tiles <br>
These were drawn by hand using an online Pixel art editor <br>
  <img src="assets/Sprint3/Grass_tile.png">
  <img src="assets/Sprint3/Fire_tile.png">
  <img src="assets/Sprint3/Water_tile.png">
  <img src="assets/Sprint3/Wall_tile.png">
<br>

We are not yet using these to draw the arena.
