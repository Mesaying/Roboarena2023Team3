<p> Task1 <br>
<p> We drafted a Mock Up of the Basic UI of the game.<br>
    The Arena will consist of diffferent types of terrain each with it's unique effect on the robot.<br>
    For example, Fire will damage the robots, Water will slow them down, while health packs restore some HP.<br>
    Our Robots will be fighting in real-time utilizing different weapons/abilities which can be selected before Playing.<br>
    <br>
    Roboarena will support both a Solo and a Multiplayer mode, the Multiplayer mode is planned to be local only for now.<br>
    In addition to each Player the arena will be populated by different AI-driven Robots the players will have to compete with.

<p> Task2 <br>
  Arena: 2 dimensional Array, size 100 * 100 to store all tiles<br>
  The arena is drawn based on a textfile. Currently the arena is drawn incorrectly. We want to fix and improve the map editor in
future and make the process of creating an arena more convenient.<br>
  To draw the arena, we iterate through the 2 dimensional array and view every element of the array. Based on the type of terrain 
  a different drawing occurs on the map.
