<p> We drafted a Mock Up of the Basic UI of the game.<br>
    The Arena will consist of diffferent types of terrain each with it's unique effect on the robot.<br>
    For example, Fire will damage the robots, Water will slow them down, while health packs restore some HP.<br>
    Our Robots will be fighting in real-time utilizing different weapons/abilities which can be selected before Playing.<br>
    <br>
    Roboarena will support both a Solo and a Multiplayer mode, plans for now are to for the Multiplayer mode to be local only.<br>
    In addition to each Player the arena will be populated by different AI-driven Robots the players will have to compete with.
