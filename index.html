<br>
<p> Task1 <br>
<p> We drafted a Mock Up of the Basic UI of the game.<br>
    The Arena will consist of diffferent types of terrain each with it's unique effect on the robot.<br>
    For example, Fire will damage the robots, Water will slow them down.<br> 
    We plan to add different boosters like Health Package or double damage rune which the players can collect during a match.<br>
    Our Robots will be fighting in real-time utilizing different weapons/abilities which can be selected before Playing.<br>
    <br>
    Roboarena will support both a Solo and a Multiplayer mode, the Multiplayer mode is planned to be local only for now.<br>
    In addition to each Player the arena will be populated by different AI-driven Robots the players will have to compete with.

<p> Task2 <br>
  Arena: 2 dimensional Array, size 100 * 100 to store all tiles<br>
  The arena is drawn based on a textfile. 
  We iterate through every letter in the textfile. Based on the letter different drawings happen in the arena and we 
  set the element in the Array to the appropriate Terrain.<br>
  At first the arena wasnt drawn correctly because line breaks were included in the array.
  We want to improve the map editor in the future and make the process of creating an arena more convenient.<br>

<p> Conclusion <br>
 We are satisfied with how the sprint went out. The programming part went relatively smooth, we have completed all tasks and
 hit our set goals.
